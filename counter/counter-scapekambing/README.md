# Project Description
This project implements a variable data width counter. The default is 32 bits.

# Key Features
1. Variable lower and upper bounds
2. Counter can begin with a default lower bound or a don't care condition. A don't care condition is not desirable for FPGA implementation
3. Asynchronous and synchornous reset modes can be used
